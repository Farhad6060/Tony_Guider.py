# Tony_Guider.py
I have made my first project which is a bot called Tony which can provide you sites as well as songs (only some for now). I have also added newsAPI which will give you the latest news going around at that time.  All thanks to CodewithHarry to help me with making this project. I have made it as simple as possible. Hope you like it.
